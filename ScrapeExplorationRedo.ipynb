Ford (CVN 78) Independent Steaming Events and Post-Planned Incremental Availability underway periods, the AAG system operated on multiple days with 100+ aircraft recoveries, including the completion of 170 arrestments in a single day. The CVN 78 completed her first Composite Training Unit Exercise in March 2023 with 60 CVW-8 aircraft embarked, encompassing 1,600 fixed-wing recoveries. The AAG system has demonstrated steadily improving performance supporting CVN 78's first operational deployment in 2023. The CVN 78 completed her maiden operational deployment in January 2024 following a 2.5-month extension. The CVN 78 safely and expeditiously launched over 8,700 aircraft during the 8.5-month deployment in support of national objectives. As of February 2024, the AAG system onboard CVN 78 recovered nearly 23,000 fixed-wing aircraft.\\n\\nThe AAG Operational Availability (Ao) is currently below the APB threshold requirement (CDD Ao). The CDD Ao requirement is the expected value after AAG reaches system maturity (25,000 cycles on one ship's system) and based on a four-engine/three-wire system. The as-installed AAG system aboard CVN 78 is a three-engine/three-wire system. The AAG system has insufficient time and cycles to accurately assess the Ao requirement and achieve the APB performance parameter. As the AAG system increases cyclic operations, increases to the system reliability and Ao are expected. The AAG program continues to address system reliability and Ao through hardware and software improvements.\\n\\nDue to fact-of-life updates in the FY 2025 PB for the AAG program, the PM Estimates for Procurement Cost and APUC result in breaches to the approved APB. Cost drivers include the increased USS Doris Miller (CVN 81) cost estimates, USS Enterprise (CVN 80) engineering changes and technical refresh due to obsolescence, production cut-in of the AAG Water Twister Mod II, replacement cost of materials cannibalized to support CVN 78 deployment, and increased costs due to delayed ship delivery. The APUC growth, the result of the increased procurement costs, is a Significant Nunn-McCurdy Unit Cost Breach. The PM notified the MDA of impending deviations and submitted a program deviation report. Within the next 90 business days, the PM will collaborate with AAG program stakeholders to determine if a program restructure is necessary and submit a revised APB to mitigate the deviation. The revised APB will also address the schedule deviation reported in the previous SAR (reported in a CVN 78 program deviation report acknowledged by the MDA in August 2023).\\n\\nThe AAG program awarded the CVN 81 pre-production planning contract in December 2021, and awarded a modification to add production and delivery-related CLINs to the contract on June 7, 2023. Pre-production efforts have identified 40 bundled obsolescence changes required for incorporation in production and retrofit in the fleet within the FYDP. The AAG Production Team is processing engineering change proposals under the CVN 81 production contract to address the obsolescence issues.\\n\\nThe AAG program is currently evaluating system software performance in an operational environment aboard CVN 78. The AAG team tracks and manages software bugs and artifacts for further investigation consideration. Some high-priority software issues have been addressed and mitigated via issuance of multiple software patches. Other software issues are being prioritized for potential inclusion in planned software engineering change proposals. Specifically, the AAG team is pursuing a funded, long-term software stability effort to address system latency and non-deterministic behavior in an effort to improve overall system performance.\\n\\n# Executive Summary\\n\\n# UNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n# 7\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Sustainment Strategy: The AAG is currently in operation onboard the CVN 78. The maintenance concept for AAG utilizes a three-level strategy (organizational (O), intermediate (I), and depot). The fleet performs O-level repairs while the ship's Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department, as well as the Carrier and Field Service Unit, perform minimal I-level repairs. For depot-level repair, the Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers, issued a depot source of repair decision on October 25, 2021, based on a joint service capability review, for both organic and contractor facilities at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst and General Atomics, respectively. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded an AAG depot stand-up contract to General Atomics, the AAG original equipment manufacturer (OEM), in January 2021. Depot stand-up commenced in FY 2024 to include OEM repairs of depot-level repairables and some organic repair capability. PMA-251 designated NAWCAD Lakehurst the AAG Software Support Activity, establishing a software support concept that leverages organic advanced test capability at NAWCAD Lakehurst and OEM subject matter experts for software development, in the fourth quarter of FY 2023. The AAG program achieved the Material Support Date on February 3, 2020, and the Naval Systems Supply Command and Defense Logistics Agency awarded spares and repair contracts for the AAG system. For fleet training, NAVAIR awarded contracts to General Atomics for interim training that will continue until the formal training curriculum and training schoolhouse are complete at the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit Norfolk in the fourth quarter of FY 2023.\\n3. Antecedent System(s) O&S Costs: No antecedent. The AAG system is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the CVN 78 Class.

FORD-class (CVN 78) aircraft carrier. The AAG is designed to provide total life-cycle cost savings by reducing O&M costs when compared to the legacy NIMITZ-class arresting gear. The AAG provides new operational capabilities necessary to achieve the CVN 78-class performance requirements, which include the ability to safely and efficiently recover both faster, heavier aircraft and future lightweight unmanned air vehicles.\\n\\nAs government-furnished equipment for the CVN 78-class aircraft carrier, the AAG program of record is four shipsets for CVN 78-CVN 81. The U.S. Navy delivered the CVN 78 to the fleet; production for the remaining AAG shipsets is underway.\\n\\nThe AAG program follows the CVN 78 program major milestone schedule. Additionally, AAG production is dependent on CVN 78 program funding allocated to support shipset and production-related procurements.\\n\\nThis acquisition is accomplished by a single program in the Major Capability Acquisition Pathway.\\n\\n# Program Use of AAF\\n\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n4 | 18', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It also includes forward-fit WT Mod II for CVN 80 and forward. The preliminary ECP (Part 1) encompasses developing the WT Mod II, producing units to be tested at the JCTS, and completing a Technical Data Package including updated Integrated Product Support products. The formal ECP (Part 2) will encompass procuring and fielding WT Mod II aboard Ford-class carriers and retrofitting the Runway Arrested Landing Site. This WT Mod II solution incorporates new, redesigned hardware subcomponents to meet established threshold requirements of the AAG operating envelope. Component design changes will maintain system performance while addressing design deficiencies that resulted in fatigue, fracture and service-life concerns, thus improving factors of safety.|\\n\\n# Tech & Systems Engineering\\n\\n# UNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n# 5 | 18', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

      "The Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) program is a system-level acquisition for a new arresting gear for the GERALD R. FORD-class (CVN 78) aircraft carrier. The AAG is designed to provide total life-cycle cost savings by reducing O&M costs when compared to the NIMITZ-class (CVN 68).

      "During the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) Independent Steaming Events and Post-Planned Incremental Availability underway periods, the AAG system operated on multiple days with 100+ aircraft recoveries, including the completion of 170 arrestments in a single day. The CVN 78 completed her first Composite Training Unit Exercise in March 2023 with 60 CVW-8 aircraft embarked, encompassing 1,600 fixed-wing recoveries. The AAG system has demonstrated steadily improving performance supporting CVN 78's first operational deployment in 2023. The CVN 78 completed her maiden operational deployment in January 2024 following a 2.5-month extension. The CVN 78 safely and expeditiously launched over 8,700 aircraft during the 8.5-month deployment in support of national objectives. As of February 2024, the AAG system onboard CVN 78 recovered nearly 23,000 fixed-wing aircraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AAG Operational Availability (Ao) is currently below the APB threshold requirement (CDD Ao). The CDD Ao requirement is the expected value after AAG reaches system maturity (25,000 cycles on one ship's system) and based on a four-engine/three-wire system. The as-installed AAG system aboard CVN 78 is a three-engine/three-wire system. The AAG system has insufficient time and cycles to accurately assess the Ao requirement and achieve the APB performance parameter. As the AAG system increases cyclic operations, increases to the system reliability and Ao are expected. The AAG program continues to address system reliability and Ao through hardware and software improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to fact-of-life updates in the FY 2025 PB for the AAG program, the PM Estimates for Procurement Cost and APUC result in breaches to the approved APB. Cost drivers include the increased USS Doris Miller (CVN 81) cost estimates, USS Enterprise (CVN 80) engineering changes and technical refresh due to obsolescence, production cut-in of the AAG Water Twister Mod II, replacement cost of materials cannibalized to support CVN 78 deployment, and increased costs due to delayed ship delivery. The APUC growth, the result of the increased procurement costs, is a Significant Nunn-McCurdy Unit Cost Breach. The PM notified the MDA of impending deviations and submitted a program deviation report. Within the next 90 business days, the PM will collaborate with AAG program stakeholders to determine if a program restructure is necessary and submit a revised APB to mitigate the deviation. The revised APB will also address the schedule deviation reported in the previous SAR (reported in a CVN 78 program deviation report acknowledged by the MDA in August 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "The AAG program awarded the CVN 81 pre-production planning contract in December 2021, and awarded a modification to add production and delivery-related CLINs to the contract on June 7, 2023. Pre-production efforts have identified 40 bundled obsolescence changes required for incorporation in production and retrofit in the fleet within the FYDP. The AAG Production Team is processing engineering change proposals under the CVN 81 production contract to address the obsolescence issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The AAG program is currently evaluating system software performance in an operational environment aboard CVN 78. The AAG team tracks and manages software bugs and artifacts for further investigation consideration. Some high-priority software issues have been addressed and mitigated via issuance of multiple software patches. Other software issues are being prioritized for potential inclusion in planned software engineering change proposals. Specifically, the AAG team is pursuing a funded, long-term software stability effort to address system latency and non-deterministic behavior in an effort to improve overall system performance.\n",

      "1. Disposal/Demilitarization Cost Estimate and Source of Estimate (cost can be total or unitized): AAG disposal costs are included in the CVN 78 Class Disposal Cost.\n",
      "2. Sustainment Strategy: The AAG is currently in operation onboard the CVN 78. The maintenance concept for AAG utilizes a three-level strategy (organizational (O), intermediate (I), and depot). The fleet performs O-level repairs while the ship's Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department, as well as the Carrier and Field Service Unit, perform minimal I-level repairs. For depot-level repair, the Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers, issued a depot source of repair decision on October 25, 2021, based on a joint service capability review, for both organic and contractor facilities at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst and General Atomics, respectively. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded an AAG depot stand-up contract to General Atomics, the AAG original equipment manufacturer (OEM), in January 2021. Depot stand-up commenced in FY 2024 to include OEM repairs of depot-level repairables and some organic repair capability. PMA-251 designated NAWCAD Lakehurst the AAG Software Support Activity, establishing a software support concept that leverages organic advanced test capability at NAWCAD Lakehurst and OEM subject matter experts for software development, in the fourth quarter of FY 2023. The AAG program achieved the Material Support Date on February 3, 2020, and the Naval Systems Supply Command and Defense Logistics Agency awarded spares and repair contracts for the AAG system. For fleet training, NAVAIR awarded contracts to General Atomics for interim training that will continue until the formal training curriculum and training schoolhouse are complete at the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit Norfolk in the fourth quarter of FY 2023.\n",
      "3. Antecedent System(s) O&S Costs: No antecedent. The AAG system is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the CVN 78 Class. The advanced technologies and capabilities, and unique ship interface requirements of AAG do not exist in any legacy recovery systems. As such, there are no comparable antecedent systems.\n",

The AAG is designed to provide total life-cycle cost savings by reducing O&M costs when compared to the legacy NIMITZ-class arresting gear. The AAG provides new operational capabilities necessary to achieve the CVN 78-class performance requirements, which include the ability to safely and efficiently recover both faster, heavier aircraft and future lightweight unmanned air vehicles.\n",

      "|ECP-I-AAG-0014 Water Twister Mod II| |May 2025|ECP-I-AAG-0014 encompasses designing, testing, and fielding a new Water Twister (WT) configuration (Mod II) to retrofit the WTs at the Jet Car Test Site (JCTS) and aboard CVN 78 and CVN 79. It also includes forward-fit WT Mod II for CVN 80 and forward. The preliminary ECP (Part 1) encompasses developing the WT Mod II, producing units to be tested at the JCTS, and completing a Technical Data Package including updated Integrated Product Support products. The formal ECP (Part 2) will encompass procuring and fielding WT Mod II aboard Ford-class carriers and retrofitting the Runway Arrested Landing Site. This WT Mod II solution incorporates new, redesigned hardware subcomponents to meet established threshold requirements of the AAG operating envelope. Component design changes will maintain system performance while addressing design deficiencies that resulted in fatigue, fracture and service-life concerns, thus improving factors of safety.|\n",

FORD-class (CVN 78) aircraft carrier. The AAG is designed to provide total life-cycle cost savings by reducing O&M costs when compared to the NIMITZ-class (CVN 68). The AAG provides new operational capabilities required by the CVN 78-class, which include the ability to safely and efficiently recover both heavier and faster aircraft as well as lightweight unmanned air vehicles that will enter the fleet in the future.\\n# AAG\\n\\n# UNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n# MSAR, December 31, 2023\\n\\n# (U) Responsible Office\\n\\n|Title|Name|Email|Phone Number|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Program Executive Officer|RADM John Lemmon|john.s.lemmon.mil@us.navy.mil (primary)|no phone number provided|\\n|Program Manager|CAPT Michael P. Kline|michael.p.kline.mil@us.navy.mil (primary)|no phone number provided|\\n\\n# Responsible Office\\n\\n# UNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n# 6\\n# AAG\\n\\n# UNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n# MSAR, December 31, 2023\\n\\n# (U) Executive Summary\\n\\n# Program Highlights Since Last Report\\n\\nDuring the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) Independent Steaming Events and Post-Planned Incremental Availability underway periods, the AAG system operated on multiple days with 100+ aircraft recoveries, including the completion of 170 arrestments in a single day. The CVN 78 completed her first Composite Training Unit Exercise in March 2023 with 60 CVW-8 aircraft embarked, encompassing 1,600 fixed-wing recoveries. The AAG system has demonstrated steadily improving performance supporting CVN 78\\'s first operational deployment in 2023. The CVN 78 completed her maiden operational deployment in January 2024 following a 2.5-month extension. The CVN 78 safely and expeditiously launched over 8,700 aircraft during the 8.5-month deployment in support of national objectives. As of February 2024, the AAG system onboard CVN 78 recovered nearly 23,000 fixed-wing aircraft.\\n\\nThe AAG Operational Availability (Ao) is currently below the APB threshold requirement (CDD Ao). The CDD Ao requirement is the expected value after AAG reaches system maturity (25,000 cycles on one ship\\'s system) and based on a four-engine/three-wire system. The as-installed AAG system aboard CVN 78 is a three-engine/three-wire system. The AAG system has insufficient time and cycles to accurately assess the Ao requirement and achieve the APB performance parameter. As the AAG system increases cyclic operations, increases to the system reliability and Ao are expected. The AAG program continues to address system reliability and Ao through hardware and software improvements.\\n\\nDue to fact-of-life updates in the FY 2025 PB for the AAG program, the PM Estimates for Procurement Cost and APUC result in breaches to the approved APB. Cost drivers include the increased USS Doris Miller (CVN 81) cost estimates, USS Enterprise (CVN 80) engineering changes and technical refresh due to obsolescence, production cut-in of the AAG Water Twister Mod II, replacement cost of materials cannibalized to support CVN 78 deployment, and increased costs due to delayed ship delivery. The APUC growth, the result of the increased procurement costs, is a Significant Nunn-McCurdy Unit Cost Breach. The PM notified the MDA of impending deviations and submitted a program deviation report. Within the next 90 business days, the PM will collaborate with AAG program stakeholders to determine if a program restructure is necessary and submit a revised APB to mitigate the deviation. The revised APB will also address the schedule deviation reported in the previous SAR (reported in a CVN 78 program deviation report acknowledged by the MDA in August 2023).\\n\\nThe AAG program awarded the CVN 81 pre-production planning contract in December 2021, and awarded a modification to add production and delivery-related CLINs to the contract on June 7, 2023. Pre-production efforts have identified 40 bundled obsolescence changes required for incorporation in production and retrofit in the fleet within the FYDP. The AAG Production Team is processing engineering change proposals under the CVN 81 production contract to address the obsolescence issues.\\n\\nThe AAG program is currently evaluating system software performance in an operational environment aboard CVN 78. The AAG team tracks and manages software bugs and artifacts for further investigation consideration. Some high-priority software issues have been addressed and mitigated via issuance of multiple software patches. Other software issues are being prioritized for potential inclusion in planned software engineering change proposals. Specifically, the AAG team is pursuing a funded, long-term software stability effort to address system latency and non-deterministic behavior in an effort to improve overall system performance.\\n\\n# Executive Summary\\n\\n# UNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n# 7\\n# AAG\\n\\n# UNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n# MSAR, December 31, 2023\\n\\nThere are no significant software-related issues with this program at this time.\\n\\n# (U) History of Significant Developments Since Program Inception\\n\\n|Date|Description|\\n|---|---|\\n|January 2024|CVN 78 completed her maiden operational deployment following a 2.5-month extension.

Sustainment Strategy: The AAG is currently in operation onboard the CVN 78. The maintenance concept for AAG utilizes a three-level strategy (organizational (O), intermediate (I), and depot). The fleet performs O-level repairs while the ship\\'s Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department, as well as the Carrier and Field Service Unit, perform minimal I-level repairs. For depot-level repair, the Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers, issued a depot source of repair decision on October 25, 2021, based on a joint service capability review, for both organic and contractor facilities at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst and General Atomics, respectively. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded an AAG depot stand-up contract to General Atomics, the AAG original equipment manufacturer (OEM), in January 2021. Depot stand-up commenced in FY 2024 to include OEM repairs of depot-level repairables and some organic repair capability. PMA-251 designated NAWCAD Lakehurst the AAG Software Support Activity, establishing a software support concept that leverages organic advanced test capability at NAWCAD Lakehurst and OEM subject matter experts for software development, in the fourth quarter of FY 2023. The AAG program achieved the Material Support Date on February 3, 2020, and the Naval Systems Supply Command and Defense Logistics Agency awarded spares and repair contracts for the AAG system. For fleet training, NAVAIR awarded contracts to General Atomics for interim training that will continue until the formal training curriculum and training schoolhouse are complete at the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit Norfolk in the fourth quarter of FY 2023.\\n3. Antecedent System(s) O&S Costs: No antecedent. The AAG system is specifically designed to meet the requirements of the CVN 78 Class.

acquisition for a new arresting gear for the GERALD R. FORD-class (CVN 78) aircraft carrier. The AAG is designed to provide total life-cycle cost savings by reducing O&M costs when compared to the legacy NIMITZ-class arresting gear. The AAG provides new operational capabilities necessary to achieve the CVN 78-class performance requirements, which include the ability to safely and efficiently recover both faster, heavier aircraft and future lightweight unmanned air vehicles.\\n\\nAs government-furnished equipment for the CVN 78-class aircraft carrier, the AAG program of record is four shipsets for CVN 78-CVN 81. The U.S. Navy delivered the CVN 78 to the fleet; production for the remaining AAG shipsets is underway.\\n\\nThe AAG program follows the CVN 78 program major milestone schedule. Additionally, AAG production is dependent on CVN 78 program funding allocated to support shipset and production-related procurements.\\n\\nThis acquisition is accomplished by a single program in the Major Capability Acquisition Pathway.\\n\\n# Program Use of AAF\\n\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n4 | 18\\n# UNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n# SAR Supplement Dec 2023\\n\\n# Technologies and Systems Engineering\\n\\n# Advanced Arresting Gear\\n\\n# Major Software Efforts\\n\\n|Title|Status|Fielding Date|Description|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|None| | | |\\n\\n# Major Engineering Changes\\n\\n|Title|Original Need Date|Fielding Date|Description, Rationale and Program Impacts|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|ECP-I-AAG-0014 Water Twister Mod II| |May 2025|ECP-I-AAG-0014 encompasses designing, testing, and fielding a new Water Twister (WT) configuration (Mod II) to retrofit the WTs at the Jet Car Test Site (JCTS) and aboard CVN 78 and CVN 79. It also includes forward-fit WT Mod II for CVN 80 and forward. The preliminary ECP (Part 1) encompasses developing the WT Mod II, producing units to be tested at the JCTS, and completing a Technical Data Package including updated Integrated Product Support products. The formal ECP (Part 2) will encompass procuring and fielding WT Mod II aboard Ford-class carriers and retrofitting the Runway Arrested Landing Site. This WT Mod II solution incorporates new, redesigned hardware subcomponents to meet established threshold requirements of the AAG operating envelope. Component design changes will maintain system performance while addressing design deficiencies that resulted in fatigue, fracture and service-life concerns, thus improving factors of safety.|\\n\\n# Tech & Systems Engineering\\n\\n# UNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n# 5 | 18\\n# UNCLASSIFIED\\n\\n# SAR Supplement Dec 2023\\n\\n# Funding Sources (Acquisition)\\n\\n# Acquisition Funding Notes\\n\\nThe CVN 78 program allocates Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy (SCN) funding to AAG from the CVN 78 SCN 17-1611 budget.\\n\\n# Advanced Arresting Gear Program\\n\\n|Category|Account|BA|Line Item|Element|RDT&E Project|Shared|Sunk|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|RDT&E|1319N|05|0604512N - Shipboard Aviation Systems|0604512N|2232 - CV/CVN Launch and Recover|x| |\\n|RDT&E|1319N|05|0604530N - Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG)|0604530N|2367 - Advanced Arresting Gear| | |\\n|Procurement|1810N|08|9020 - Spares and Repair Parts|0204112N|-|x| |\\n|Procurement|1810N|03|4213 - Aircraft Support Equipment|0204112N|-|x|x|\\n|Procurement|1810N|03|4216 - Aircraft Launch & Recovery Equipment|0204112N|-|x|x|\\n|Procurement|1810N|03|4217 - Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG)|0204112N|-| | |\\n|Procurement|1611N|02|2001 - Carrier Replacement Program|0204112N|-|x| |\\n|MILCON|1205N|XX|OTHER - Other or New 1205N Line Item|XXX|XXX - --|x| |\\n\\nNote: This appropriation is shared with all Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) products, except Expeditionary Airfields.\\n\\nNote: This appropriation is shared with all ALRE products.\\n\\nNote: This appropriation is shared with all ALRE products and encompasses 4216 as a cost type starting in FY 2015.\\n\\nNote: This appropriation is active per the PB.
