             Mission
             The Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) program is a system-level acquisition for a new arresting
             gear for the GERALD R. FORD-class (CVN 78) aircraft carrier. The AAG is designed to provide
             total life-cycle cost savings by reducing O&M costs when compared to the NIMITZ-class (CVN
             68). The AAG provides new operational capabilities required by the CVN 78-class, which include
             the ability to safely and efficiently recover both heavier and faster aircraft as well as lightweight
             unmanned air vehicles that will enter the fleet in the future.

    (U) Executive Summary

        Program Highlights Since Last Report
        During the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) Independent Steaming Events and Post-Planned
        Incremental Availability underway periods, the AAG system operated on multiple days with 100+
        aircraft recoveries, including the completion of 170 arrestments in a single day. The CVN 78
        completed her first Composite Training Unit Exercise in March 2023 with 60 CVW-8 aircraft
        embarked, encompassing 1,600 fixed-wing recoveries. The AAG system has demonstrated
        steadily improving performance supporting CVN 78's first operational deployment in 2023.
        The CVN 78 completed her maiden operational deployment in January 2024 following a 2.5-
        month extension. The CVN 78 safely and expeditiously launched over 8,700 aircraft during the
        8.5-month deployment in support of national objectives. As of February 2024, the AAG system
        onboard CVN 78 recovered nearly 23,000 fixed-wing aircraft.
        The AAG Operational Availability (Ao) is currently below the APB threshold requirement (CDD
        Ao). The CDD Ao requirement is the expected value after AAG reaches system maturity (25,000
        cycles on one ship's system) and based on a four-engine/three-wire system. The as-installed
        AAG system aboard CVN 78 is a three-engine/three-wire system. The AAG system has
        insufficient time and cycles to accurately assess the Ao requirement and achieve the APB
        performance parameter. As the AAG system increases cyclic operations, increases to the
        system reliability and Ao are expected. The AAG program continues to address system reliability
        and Ao through hardware and software improvements.
        Due to fact-of-life updates in the FY 2025 PB for the AAG program, the PM Estimates for
        Procurement Cost and APUC result in breaches to the approved APB. Cost drivers include the
        increased USS Doris Miller (CVN 81) cost estimates, USS Enterprise (CVN 80) engineering
        changes and technical refresh due to obsolescence, production cut-in of the AAG Water Twister
        Mod II, replacement cost of materials cannibalized to support CVN 78 deployment, and
        increased costs due to delayed ship delivery. The APUC growth, the result of the increased
        procurement costs, is a Significant Nunn-McCurdy Unit Cost Breach. The PM notified the MDA of
        impending deviations and submitted a program deviation report. Within the next 90 business
        days, the PM will collaborate with AAG program stakeholders to determine if a program
        restructure is necessary and submit a revised APB to mitigate the deviation. The revised APB
        will also address the schedule deviation reported in the previous SAR (reported in a CVN 78
        program deviation report acknowledged by the MDA in August 2023).
        The AAG program awarded the CVN 81 pre-production planning contract in December 2021, and
        awarded a modification to add production and delivery-related CLINs to the contract on June 7,
        2023. Pre-production efforts have identified 40 bundled obsolescence changes required for
        incorporation in production and retrofit in the fleet within the FYDP. The AAG Production Team is
        processing engineering change proposals under the CVN 81 production contract to address the
        obsolescence issues.
        The AAG program is currently evaluating system software performance in an operational
        environment aboard CVN 78. The AAG team tracks and manages software bugs and artifacts
        for further investigation consideration. Some high-priority software issues have been addressed
        and mitigated via issuance of multiple software patches. Other software issues are being
        prioritized for potential inclusion in planned software engineering change proposals. Specifically,
        the AAG team is pursuing a funded, long-term software stability effort to address system
        latency and non-deterministic behavior in an effort to improve overall system performance.

          Date           Description
                         deadloads, at the Lakehurst Jet Car Track Site (JCTS).
          August 2018    AAG SDD contract Over Target Baseline/Over Target Schedule re-plan completed.
          January 2018   USD(AT&L) delegated MDA to ASN(RDA) and re-designated AAG an ACAT IC program.
          December 2017  The AAG program submitted the AAG Software plan addressing software safety and
                         requirements that reflect the operational concept addressed in the AAG Nunn McCurdy
                         Certification ADM.
          November 2017  The AAG program proposed an adjusted APB based on the CAPE ICE completed July 2017
                         for the Nunn McCurdy review. On November 17, 2017, the USD(AT&L) approved the APB,
                         which became the original baseline.
          July 2017      The Nunn McCurdy review and certification of AAG completed and documented, and
                         USD(AT&L) designated AAG an ACAT ID program in the July 12, 2017 Acquisition Decision
                         Memorandum.
          May 2017       PMA 251 submitted a Nunn McCurdy SAR in accordance with the NDAA FY 2017 Section
                         125.
          May 2017       CVN 79 AAG contract option exercised for the CVN 80 AAG system.
          December 2016  Navy Center for Cost Analysis completed the AAG Component Cost Position.
          December 2016  Section 125 of the National Defense Authorization Act includes a requirement to perform
                         a Nunn- McCurdy review of AAG using the 2009 APB.
          July 2015      USD(AT&L) reclassified AAG as an ACAT IC program.
          June 2015      ASN requested USD(AT&L) reclassify AAG as an ACAT IC program.
          March 2015     PMA 251 requested the re-designation of Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) as an ACAT IC
                         program (from an ACAT II program).

        Schedule Notes:
        Current APB: AAG Development APB Change 1, approved February 5, 2020
        The AAG IOT&E current estimate changed from Nov 2023 to Mar 2025 for consistency with the CVN
        78 IOT&E completion current estimate date.

        Schedule Baseline Deviation Explanation
        The IOT&E completion date change is based on the projected future Composite Training Unit
        Exercise schedule planned for early 2025 that incorporates sortie generation rate demonstration.
        The IOT&E completion current estimate has changed from March 2025 to May 2025 due to the CVN
        78's extended deployment. This schedule deviation was reported in the December 2022 SAR and the
        CVN 78 program deviation report acknowledged by the MDA in August 2023. The PM will submit a
        revised APB to mitigate this deviation.

Explanation
The Procurement Cost breach is attributed to production-related fact-of-life
updates to the AAG program. Cost drivers include the increased CVN 81 cost
estimates, CVN 80 engineering changes and technical refresh due to
obsolescence, production cut-in of the AAG Water Twister Mod II, replacement
cost of materials cannibalized to support CVN 78 deployment, and increased
costs due to delayed ship delivery. The PM notified the MDA of the breach and
submitted a program deviation report.
None
The significant APUC breach (18% over the current baseline estimate) is the
result of the increased procurement costs.

                (U) Risk and Sensitivity Analysis
                 Current Procurement Estimate Risks (12/31/2023)
                 1        The current procurement estimate reflects the May 2, 2019 PLCCE that was approved in support of AAG APB
                          Change 1. The risk and sensitivity analysis performed in support of APB Change 1 remains current and
                          unchanged.
                 Current Baseline Risks (2/5/2020)
                 The current baseline estimate reflects a CAPE ICE approved in July 2017 in support of the AAG Nunn McCurdy
                 certification and establishes the revised APB for the program's reclassification as an ACAT 1C Program. Software
                 development was identified as the primary risk to the System Development & Demonstration program. The new
                 schedule also added deadload and aircraft recoveries to the Dynamic Control System Software releases.

        (U) Current Cost Estimate Sources
        Operating and Support Cost
        Type: Program Office Estimate
        Approved by: PMA-251, January 15, 2024
        Note: a. Disposal/Demilitarization Cost Estimate and Source of Estimate (cost can be total or
        unitized): AAG disposal costs are included in the CVN 78 Class Disposal Cost.

        b. Sustainment Strategy: The AAG is currently in operation onboard the CVN 78. The maintenance
        concept for AAG utilizes a three-level strategy (organizational (O), intermediate (I), and depot). The
        fleet performs O-level repairs while the ship's Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department, as well
        as the Carrier and Field Service Unit, perform minimal I-level repairs. For depot-level repair, the
        Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers, issued a depot source of repair decision on October 25, 2021,
        based on a joint service capability review, for both organic and contractor facilities at the Naval Air
        Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst and General Atomics, respectively. The Naval
        Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded an AAG depot stand-up contract to General Atomics, the
        AAG original equipment manufacturer (OEM), in January 2021. Depot stand-up commenced in FY
        2024 to include OEM repairs of depot-level repairables and some organic repair capability. PMA-251
        designated NAWCAD Lakehurst the AAG Software Support Activity, establishing a software support
        concept that leverages organic advanced test capability at NAWCAD Lakehurst and OEM subject
        matter experts for software development, in the fourth quarter of FY 2023. The AAG program
        achieved the Material Support Date on February 3, 2020, and the Naval Systems Supply Command
        and Defense Logistics Agency awarded spares and repair contracts for the AAG system. For fleet
        training, NAVAIR awarded contracts to General Atomics for interim training that will continue until
        the formal training curriculum and training schoolhouse are complete at the Center for Naval
        Aviation Technical Training Unit Norfolk in the fourth quarter of FY 2023.

        c. Antecedent System(s) O&S Costs: No antecedent. The AAG system is specifically designed to
        meet the requirements of the CVN 78 Class. The advanced technologies and capabilities, and
        unique ship interface requirements of AAG do not exist in any legacy recovery systems. As such,
        there are no comparable antecedent systems.

            Notes:                             Contract N0001922C0033 is a combined EMALS and AAG CVN 81 Pre-production
                                               contract with a total contract value of $1,362.39M. NAVAIR awarded a modification to
                                               the base contract to add CVN 81 EMALS and AAG shipset production and delivery-
                                               related CLINs. The difference between the Initial Contract Price Target and the Current
                                               Contract Price Target is due to contract modifications to add the CVN 81 AAG shipset
                                               as well as other AAG production-related requirements.

        Rationale if LRIP Quantity Exceeds 10% of Total Procurement Quantity (Current Determination)
        The Original Total LRIP Quantity is more than 10% of the total production quantity as MDA approved
        and documented in the Milestone B ADM, dated February 10, 2005. The initial LRIP quantities were
        required to establish an initial production base for the system. Assistant Secretary of the Navy for
        Research, Development and Acquisition memorandum, "Revision to Milestone B Approval of
        Advanced Arresting Gear Program Decision Memorandum" of December 22, 2015, approved the
        procurement of the first full-rate production shipset to be installed on CVN 80, starting in FY 2017.
        Therefore, the only two LRIP shipsets are CVN 78 and CVN 79.

    (U) International Program Aspects

        General Memo
        The U.S. Navy (USN) is currently working with the French under multiple FMS cases for the Future
        French Carrier (FFC). Performance under the first FFC-related FMS Letter of Offer and Acceptance
        (LOA) (with three amendments) for trade studies and technical assistance ended in December
        2022. The U.S. and French signed a second LOA in July 2021 for the AAG/Electromagnetic Aircraft
        Launch System (EMALS) Risk Reduction Case; the case was amended in December 2022 to extend
        performance through April 2024 and further amended in October 2023 to extend performance
        through Jan 2025. A third case was signed in March 2022 for AAG/EMALS long lead-time materials.
        This case was amended in July 2023 to include Development Phase 1 efforts through 2025. The
        Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment program office (PMA-251) intends to recommend
        amending this case in 2025 to include Development Phase 2 efforts through 2027 and Production
        efforts through 2038. The USN will continue to refine the rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost
        estimate until the production decision in 2025. A fourth case was signed in September 2022 for
        feasibility studies and planning for the future Rafale Aircraft Compatibility Testing (ACT) campaign.
        An amendment signed in May 2023 extended the case period of performance through September
        2023. A second amendment to further extend the case through May 2024 was signed in December
        2023.
        After Rafale ACT planning case signature, a working group convened at Lakehurst, NJ where France
        requested a shift in the Rafale test plan. A limited ACT campaign is planned for 2025 to support the
        AAG/EMALS production decision. A new schedule and updated cost estimate were developed to
        support a 2024 LOA Amendment for the 2025 ACT campaign. The LOA amendment was offered to
        the French on February 15, 2024 and is pending acceptance.
        A combined USN/France ship integration team was established in January 2023 and will meet
        quarterly through ship delivery in 2036.

        Exportability and Business Issues
        The USN and the Indian Navy conducted several face-to-face meetings and continued monthly
        discussions under their Information Exchange Agreement on Aircraft Carrier Technologies.
        PMA-251 provided a Pricing and Availability (P&A) ROM statement for AAG/EMALS to India in 2017
        and is supporting a PEO(Carriers) LOA for a training capsule on ship-design aspects related to
        aviation.

          Is design for international exportability   No          Industry/Partner Exportability Cost-Sharing?      No
          planned?
          If not, has the MDA approved an             Not Applicable
          exportability waiver for a U.S.-only design?

        Program Protection: Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure Issues
        The AAG system is U.S. critical technology and not openly distributable to foreign countries. Foreign
        participation is restricted due to critical program information. The AAG Technology Transfer and
        Security Assistance Review Board documentation is complete and an Exception to National

 Program Use of the Adaptive Acquisition Framework

The AAG program is a system-level acquisition for a new arresting gear for the GERALD R. FORD-class (CVN 78)
aircraft carrier. The AAG is designed to provide total life-cycle cost savings by reducing O&M costs when
compared to the legacy NIMITZ-class arresting gear. The AAG provides new operational capabilities necessary to
achieve the CVN 78-class performance requirements, which include the ability to safely and efficiently recover
both faster, heavier aircraft and future lightweight unmanned air vehicles.

As government-furnished equipment for the CVN 78-class aircraft carrier, the AAG program of record is four
shipsets for CVN 78-CVN 81. The U.S. Navy delivered the CVN 78 to the fleet; production for the remaining AAG
shipsets is underway.

The AAG program follows the CVN 78 program major milestone schedule. Additionally, AAG production is
dependent on CVN 78 program funding allocated to support shipset and production-related procurements.

This acquisition is accomplished by a single program in the Major Capability Acquisition Pathway.

Date              Fielding Date Description, Rationale and Program Impacts
                  May 2025          ECP-I-AAG-0014 encompasses designing, testing, and fielding a new
                                    Water Twister (WT) configuration (Mod II) to retrofit the WTs at the Jet
                                    Car Test Site (JCTS) and aboard CVN 78 and CVN 79. It also includes
                                    forward-fit WT Mod II for CVN 80 and forward. The preliminary ECP (Part
                                    1) encompasses developing the WT Mod II, producing units to be tested
                                    at the JCTS, and completing a Technical Data Package including
                                    updated Integrated Product Support products. The formal ECP (Part 2)
                                    will encompass procuring and fielding WT Mod II aboard Ford-class
                                    carriers and retrofitting the Runway Arrested Landing Site. This WT Mod
                                    II solution incorporates new, redesigned hardware subcomponents to
                                    meet established threshold requirements of the AAG operating envelope.
                                    Component design changes will maintain system performance while
                                    addressing design deficiencies that resulted in fatigue, fracture and
                                    service-life concerns, thus improving factors of safety.

     additional ship added to program of record
     2.0 Unit Operations - N/A
     3.0 Maintenance - Updated data and methodology impacted average cost per year
     4.0 Sustaining Support - Revised methodology and additional ship added to program of record
     impacted average cost per year
     5.0 Continued System Improvements - Updated methodology and additional ship added to program of

     The 2017 ICE occured when the CAPE O&S structure reflected 2014 guidance, including 6.0 Indirect
     Support. Current CAPE 2020 structure removed element 6.0. Therefore 6.0 costs are not shown in
     the 1/15/2024 Current Estimate in the comparison table.
