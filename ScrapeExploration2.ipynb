Ford (CVN 78) Independent Steaming Events and Post-Planned\\n        Incremental Availability underway periods, the AAG system operated on multiple days with 100+\\n        aircraft recoveries, including the completion of 170 arrestments in a single day. The CVN 78\\n        completed her first Composite Training Unit Exercise in March 2023 with 60 CVW-8 aircraft\\n        embarked, encompassing 1,600 fixed-wing recoveries. The AAG system has demonstrated\\n        steadily improving performance supporting CVN 78's first operational deployment in 2023.\\n        The CVN 78 completed her maiden operational deployment in January 2024 following a 2.5-\\n        month extension. The CVN 78 safely and expeditiously launched over 8,700 aircraft during the\\n        8.5-month deployment in support of national objectives. As of February 2024, the AAG system\\n        onboard CVN 78 recovered nearly 23,000 fixed-wing aircraft.\\n        The AAG Operational Availability (Ao) is currently below the APB threshold requirement (CDD\\n        Ao). The CDD Ao requirement is the expected value after AAG reaches system maturity (25,000\\n        cycles on one ship's system) and based on a four-engine/three-wire system. The as-installed\\n        AAG system aboard CVN 78 is a three-engine/three-wire system. The AAG system has\\n        insufficient time and cycles to accurately assess the Ao requirement and achieve the APB\\n        performance parameter. As the AAG system increases cyclic operations, increases to the\\n        system reliability and Ao are expected. The AAG program continues to address system reliability\\n        and Ao through hardware and software improvements.\\n        Due to fact-of-life updates in the FY 2025 PB for the AAG program, the PM Estimates for\\n        Procurement Cost and APUC result in breaches to the approved APB. Cost drivers include the\\n        increased USS Doris Miller (CVN 81) cost estimates, USS Enterprise (CVN 80) engineering\\n        changes and technical refresh due to obsolescence, production cut-in of the AAG Water Twister\\n        Mod II, replacement cost of materials cannibalized to support CVN 78 deployment, and\\n        increased costs due to delayed ship delivery. The APUC growth, the result of the increased\\n        procurement costs, is a Significant Nunn-McCurdy Unit Cost Breach. The PM notified the MDA of\\n        impending deviations and submitted a program deviation report. Within the next 90 business\\n        days, the PM will collaborate with AAG program stakeholders to determine if a program\\n        restructure is necessary and submit a revised APB to mitigate the deviation. The revised APB\\n        will also address the schedule deviation reported in the previous SAR (reported in a CVN 78\\n        program deviation report acknowledged by the MDA in August 2023).\\n        The AAG program awarded the CVN 81 pre-production planning contract in December 2021, and\\n        awarded a modification to add production and delivery-related CLINs to the contract on June 7,\\n        2023. Pre-production efforts have identified 40 bundled obsolescence changes required for\\n        incorporation in production and retrofit in the fleet within the FYDP. The AAG Production Team is\\n        processing engineering change proposals under the CVN 81 production contract to address the\\n        obsolescence issues.\\n        The AAG program is currently evaluating system software performance in an operational\\n        environment aboard CVN 78. The AAG team tracks and manages software bugs and artifacts\\n        for further investigation consideration. Some high-priority software issues have been addressed\\n        and mitigated via issuance of multiple software patches. Other software issues are being\\n        prioritized for potential inclusion in planned software engineering change proposals. Specifically,\\n        the AAG team is pursuing a funded, long-term software stability effort to address system\\n        latency and non-deterministic behavior in an effort to improve overall system performance.\\n\\nExecutive Summary                                      UNCLASSIFIED                                                     7\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Disposal/Demilitarization Cost Estimate and Source of Estimate (cost can be total or\\n        unitized): AAG disposal costs are included in the CVN 78 Class Disposal Cost.\\n\\n        b. Sustainment Strategy: The AAG is currently in operation onboard the CVN 78. The maintenance\\n        concept for AAG utilizes a three-level strategy (organizational (O), intermediate (I), and depot). The\\n        fleet performs O-level repairs while the ship's Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department, as well\\n        as the Carrier and Field Service Unit, perform minimal I-level repairs. For depot-level repair, the\\n        Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers, issued a depot source of repair decision on October 25, 2021,\\n        based on a joint service capability review, for both organic and contractor facilities at the Naval Air\\n        Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst and General Atomics, respectively. The Naval\\n        Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) awarded an AAG depot stand-up contract to General Atomics, the\\n        AAG original equipment manufacturer (OEM), in January 2021. Depot stand-up commenced in FY\\n        2024 to include OEM repairs of depot-level repairables and some organic repair capability. PMA-251\\n        designated NAWCAD Lakehurst the AAG Software Support Activity, establishing a software support\\n        concept that leverages organic advanced test capability at NAWCAD Lakehurst and OEM subject\\n        matter experts for software development, in the fourth quarter of FY 2023. The AAG program\\n        achieved the Material Support Date on February 3, 2020, and the Naval Systems Supply Command\\n        and Defense Logistics Agency awarded spares and repair contracts for the AAG system. For fleet\\n        training, NAVAIR awarded contracts to General Atomics for interim training that will continue until\\n        the formal training curriculum and training schoolhouse are complete at the Center for Naval\\n        Aviation Technical Training Unit Norfolk in the fourth quarter of FY 2023.\\n\\n        c. Antecedent System(s) O&S Costs: No antecedent. The AAG system is specifically designed to\\n        meet the requirements of the CVN 78 Class. The advanced technologies and capabilities, and\\n        unique ship interface requirements of AAG do not exist in any legacy recovery systems.

Performance under the first FFC-related FMS Letter of Offer and Acceptance\\n        (LOA) (with three amendments) for trade studies and technical assistance ended in December\\n        2022. The U.S. and French signed a second LOA in July 2021 for the AAG/Electromagnetic Aircraft\\n        Launch System (EMALS) Risk Reduction Case; the case was amended in December 2022 to extend\\n        performance through April 2024 and further amended in October 2023 to extend performance\\n        through Jan 2025. A third case was signed in March 2022 for AAG/EMALS long lead-time materials.\\n        This case was amended in July 2023 to include Development Phase 1 efforts through 2025. The\\n        Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment program office (PMA-251) intends to recommend\\n        amending this case in 2025 to include Development Phase 2 efforts through 2027 and Production\\n        efforts through 2038. The USN will continue to refine the rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost\\n        estimate until the production decision in 2025. A fourth case was signed in September 2022 for\\n        feasibility studies and planning for the future Rafale Aircraft Compatibility Testing (ACT) campaign.\\n        An amendment signed in May 2023 extended the case period of performance through September\\n        2023. A second amendment to further extend the case through May 2024 was signed in December\\n        2023.\\n        After Rafale ACT planning case signature, a working group convened at Lakehurst, NJ where France\\n        requested a shift in the Rafale test plan. A limited ACT campaign is planned for 2025 to support the\\n        AAG/EMALS production decision. A new schedule and updated cost estimate were developed to\\n        support a 2024 LOA Amendment for the 2025 ACT campaign. The LOA amendment was offered to\\n        the French on February 15, 2024 and is pending acceptance.\\n        A combined USN/France ship integration team was established in January 2023 and will meet\\n        quarterly through ship delivery in 2036.\\n\\n        Exportability and Business Issues\\n        The USN and the Indian Navy conducted several face-to-face meetings and continued monthly\\n        discussions under their Information Exchange Agreement on Aircraft Carrier Technologies.\\n        PMA-251 provided a Pricing and Availability (P&A) ROM statement for AAG/EMALS to India in 2017\\n        and is supporting a PEO(Carriers) LOA for a training capsule on ship-design aspects related to\\n        aviation.\\n\\n          Is design for international exportability   No          Industry/Partner Exportability Cost-Sharing?

FORD-class (CVN 78)\\naircraft carrier. The AAG is designed to provide total life-cycle cost savings by reducing O&M costs when\\ncompared to the legacy NIMITZ-class arresting gear. The AAG provides new operational capabilities necessary to\\nachieve the CVN 78-class performance requirements, which include the ability to safely and efficiently recover\\nboth faster, heavier aircraft and future lightweight unmanned air vehicles.\\n\\nAs government-furnished equipment for the CVN 78-class aircraft carrier, the AAG program of record is four\\nshipsets for CVN 78-CVN 81.
